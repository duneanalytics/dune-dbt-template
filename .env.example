# Environment Variables Reference
#
# This file is a REFERENCE ONLY - it is NOT automatically loaded or sourced.
# 
# To use these variables, you must explicitly set them in your environment:
#
# Method 1: Add to your shell profile (persistent, recommended)
#   For zsh: echo 'export DUNE_API_KEY=your_key' >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc
#   For bash: echo 'export DUNE_API_KEY=your_key' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
#   For fish: echo 'set -x DUNE_API_KEY your_key' >> ~/.config/fish/config.fish && source ~/.config/fish/config.fish
#
# Method 2: Export for current session (temporary)
#   bash/zsh: export DUNE_API_KEY=your_key
#   fish: set -x DUNE_API_KEY your_key
#
# Method 3: Inline with command (one-off)
#   DUNE_API_KEY=your_key DUNE_TEAM_NAME=your_team uv run dbt debug
